# TurkishPoemGenerator_NLP

`TurkishPoemGenerator_NLP` is a project that demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate Turkish poems using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model.

## Project Overview

The project involves collecting a dataset of Turkish poems, pre-processing the data, fine-tuning a GPT-2 model on the pre-processed data, and generating new poems using the fine-tuned model.

The project uses Python and various NLP libraries, including `transformers`, `pandas`, and `numpy`. The pre-processing steps include cleaning the data, tokenizing the text, and creating input sequences for the model.


## Usage

To use the model to generate new Turkish poems, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the Turkish poems dataset and save it in the `data` directory.
3. Run the `preprocess_data.py` script to pre-process the data.
4. Run the `train_model.py` script to fine-tune the GPT-2 model.
5. Run the `generate_poem.py` script to generate new poems.
